## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] All 3 campuses have complete role sets
- [x] Each campus has at least 1 admin, 1 faculty, 1 cashier, and 2 students
- [x] Super Admin has global access
- [x] All users have proper role assignments
- [x] Permissions are correctly mapped to roles
- [x] Module access is properly configured
- [x] Database migrations run successfully
- [x] All seeders run without errors
- [x] SQLite compatibility issues resolved

---

## üìå Notes

1. **Password Security:** All users currently use `Password123!` for testing. In production, implement proper password policies and force password changes on first login.

2. **Campus Isolation:** Campus-specific roles are properly isolated. A Campus Admin from MAIN cannot access ANTIPOLO or SUBIC campus data.

3. **Role Flexibility:** The system supports multiple roles per user (though current seeders assign one primary role).

4. **Inactive Users:** `student4@icct.edu.ph` is marked as inactive for testing inactive account handling.

5. **Database:** Currently using SQLite for development. All queries are compatible with both SQLite and MySQL.

---

## üîÑ Resetting the Database

To reset and reseed the database:

```bash
cd /Users/aldrincruzomnes/SKOLARIS/skolaris-be
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will:

1. Drop all tables
2. Run all migrations
3. Seed all data (roles, users, permissions, academic data, etc.)

---

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:

- Check the Laravel logs: `/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Verify database connection in `.env`
- Ensure all migrations are up to date
- Check role and permission assignments in the database
