# Multi-Dashboard System Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive multi-dashboard system that provides different dashboard views based on user roles and campuses. The system automatically routes users to appropriate dashboards based on their active role and campus assignment.

## System Architecture

### 1. Dashboard Router (`DashboardRouter.jsx`)

- **Purpose**: Central routing component that determines which dashboard to display
- **Logic**: Routes based on `user.active_role.role_name` and `campus_id`
- **Fallback**: Default dashboard for unknown roles

### 2. Base Dashboard (`BaseDashboard.jsx`)

- **Purpose**: Common layout and utilities for all role-specific dashboards
- **Features**:
  - Campus-specific color coding
  - Role-specific icons
  - Consistent layout structure
  - Stats grid, quick actions, recent activity, announcements
  - Charts placeholder areas

### 3. Role-Specific Dashboards

#### Global Roles (System-wide access):

- **Super Admin Dashboard**: System-wide administration, user management, campus settings, audit logs
- **Central Office Dashboard**: Institution-level reporting and user management
- **Academic Affairs Dashboard**: Academic policy and compliance monitoring
- **Academic Officer Dashboard**: Cross-campus analytics and coordination
- **President Dashboard**: Executive overview and KPIs
- **Marketing Dashboard**: Lead management and campaign monitoring

#### Campus-Specific Roles (per campus):

- **Academic Coordinator Dashboard**: Chief academic officer for campus
- **Dean Dashboard**: College oversight and faculty coordination
- **Department Head Dashboard**: Faculty supervision and load approval
- **Registrar Dashboard**: Enrollment and student records management
- **Faculty Dashboard**: Class management and grade encoding
- **Accounting Dashboard**: Financial management and billing
- **Student Affairs Dashboard**: Discipline and counseling
- **Campus Coordinator Dashboard**: Administrative support
- **System Staff Dashboard**: Data entry and management
- **Student Dashboard**: Self-service portal for students

## Key Features

### 1. Campus-Aware Design

- **Color Coding**: Each campus has distinct colors (Main: Blue, Antipolo: Green, Subic: Purple)
- **Campus Context**: All dashboards show campus-specific information
- **Campus Filtering**: Data and actions are filtered by user's campus

### 2. Role-Based Content

- **Customized Stats**: Each role sees relevant metrics
- **Quick Actions**: Role-appropriate action buttons
- **Recent Activity**: Role-specific activity feeds
- **Announcements**: Campus and role-relevant announcements

### 3. Responsive Layout

- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive grid layouts
- **Consistent UI**: Unified design language across all dashboards
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast and navigation

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Components Created:

1. `DashboardRouter.jsx` - Main routing component
2. `BaseDashboard.jsx` - Base layout component
3. `SuperAdminDashboard.jsx` - Fully implemented Super Admin dashboard
4. `CampusAcademicCoordinatorDashboard.jsx` - Fully implemented Academic Coordinator dashboard
5. `StudentDashboard.jsx` - Fully implemented Student dashboard
6. `CentralOfficeDashboard.jsx` - Central Office dashboard
7. `AcademicAffairsDashboard.jsx` - Academic Affairs dashboard
8. `PlaceholderDashboards.jsx` - Placeholder components for remaining roles
9. `DefaultDashboard.jsx` - Fallback dashboard for unknown roles

### Updated Components:

- `Dashboard.jsx` - Now uses DashboardRouter instead of static content

## Usage

### How It Works:

1. User logs in and their active role is determined
2. DashboardRouter checks the user's active role name
3. Routes to appropriate dashboard component
4. Dashboard displays campus-specific and role-specific content

### Example Scenarios:

- **Super Admin**: Sees system-wide stats, all campuses, user management
- **Academic Coordinator (Main Campus)**: Sees Main Campus academic stats, faculty management
- **Student (Antipolo Campus)**: Sees Antipolo Campus schedule, grades, assignments
- **Registrar (Subic Campus)**: Sees Subic Campus enrollment data, student records

## Benefits

1. **Personalized Experience**: Each user sees relevant information for their role and campus
2. **Scalable**: Easy to add new roles or campuses
3. **Maintainable**: Centralized routing logic with modular components
4. **Consistent**: Unified design language across all dashboards
5. **Efficient**: Role-specific quick actions and relevant data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Data Integration**: Replace mock data with actual API calls
2. **Chart Implementation**: Add real charts using chart libraries
3. **Notifications**: Real-time notifications system
4. **Customization**: Allow users to customize their dashboard layout
5. **Analytics**: Add detailed analytics and reporting features

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:

- `/src/components/dashboards/DashboardRouter.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/BaseDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/SuperAdminDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/CampusAcademicCoordinatorDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/StudentDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/CentralOfficeDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/AcademicAffairsDashboard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/PlaceholderDashboards.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboards/DefaultDashboard.jsx`

### Modified Files:

- `/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated to use DashboardRouter

The multi-dashboard system is now ready for use and can be easily extended with additional role-specific dashboards as needed.
