## 🔍 How Trello Sync Works

### Code from trello-integration.js (Line 980-988):

```javascript
// Extract task details
const basicDetails = card.querySelectorAll(".task-details li");
if (basicDetails.length > 0) {
  basicDetails.forEach((item) => {
    const text = item.textContent.trim();
    if (text) {
      details.push(`• ${text}`);
    }
  });
}
```

**What this means:**

- ✅ Kukunin LAHAT ng `<li>` items sa loob ng `.task-details`
- ✅ Including regular items
- ✅ Including **purple-highlighted enhanced items**
- ✅ Including ALL text content
