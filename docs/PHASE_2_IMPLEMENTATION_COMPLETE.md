## 📝 Notes for Developers

2. All pages use consistent state management with useState
3. Error handling uses try-catch blocks
4. Success/error messages displayed via modals or alerts
5. Loading states managed with boolean flags
6. Forms use controlled components

### Best Practices:

- Always handle loading states
- Always handle error states
- Always show user feedback
- Always validate forms
- Always confirm destructive actions
- Always use TypeScript-style JSDoc for better IDE support
- Always follow existing naming conventions

### Maintenance:

- Update API base URL if backend changes
- Update role names if backend changes role structure
- Check for breaking changes in backend API
- Test thoroughly after backend updates
- Keep documentation up to date
