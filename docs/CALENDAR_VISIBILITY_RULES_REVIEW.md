## ⚠️ **CURRENT ISSUES**

### 1. **422 Validation Error** 🚨

**Status:** ACTIVE ISSUE

**Problem:**

- Creating visibility rules results in 422 (Unprocessable Content)
- Backend validation is failing

**Debugging Added:**

```javascript
// Console logs now show:
- "Submitting form data:" - What's being sent
- "Create visibility rule error:" - Full error response
- "Validation errors:" - Specific field errors
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Field Name Mismatch** - Frontend uses different names than backend expects
2. **Data Type Mismatch** - Arrays might need to be formatted differently
3. **Missing Required Fields** - Backend might require additional fields
4. **Empty Arrays** - Backend might reject empty arrays

**Next Steps:**

1. Check console for "Validation errors:" output
2. Verify backend expects these field names:
   - `visibility_name`
   - `description`
   - `visible_to_role_ids` (array of integers)
   - `visible_to_program_ids` (array of integers)
   - `visible_to_campus_ids` (array of integers)
   - `is_active` (boolean)

### 2. **Rules Not Appearing in List** 📋

**Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Problem:**

- Rules are created successfully (visible in Academic Calendar dropdown)
- But don't appear in Calendar Visibility Rules list page

**Debugging Added:**

```javascript
// Console logs now show:
- "Raw API response for getVisibilityRules:" - API response structure
- "Setting visibility rules:" - Processed rules array
- "Number of rules:" - Count of rules loaded
```

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Data Path Mismatch** - Currently tries `result.data.data` OR `result.data`
2. **Response Structure** - Backend might return different structure
3. **Filtering Issue** - Rules might be filtered out by default

**Next Steps:**

1. Check console for actual response structure
2. Verify array path is correct
3. Check if filters are hiding the rules

### 3. **Missing Backend API** ❌

**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Missing Endpoint:**

```
GET /api/v1/academic-calendar-visibility/{id}/usage
```

**Purpose:** Check if a visibility rule is being used by calendar events

**Current Status:**

- Frontend has the method: `checkRuleUsage()`
- But it's disabled to avoid 404 errors
- Delete validation relies on backend constraint errors instead

**Impact:**

- ⚠️ Can't show visual indicators for rules in use
- ⚠️ Can't prevent delete attempts before API call
- ✅ Still works via backend constraint errors

---

## 📋 **API ENDPOINTS USED**

### **Working:**

1. ✅ `GET /academic-calendar-visibility` - Fetch all rules
2. ✅ `GET /academic-calendar-visibility/{id}` - Fetch single rule
3. ✅ `POST /academic-calendar-visibility` - Create rule (has validation issues)
4. ✅ `PUT /academic-calendar-visibility/{id}` - Update rule
5. ✅ `DELETE /academic-calendar-visibility/{id}` - Delete rule
6. ✅ `GET /academic-calendar-visibility/options` - Get dropdown options

### **Not Implemented:**

1. ❌ `GET /academic-calendar-visibility/{id}/usage` - Check rule usage
2. ❌ `GET /academic-calendar-visibility/stats` - Get statistics (optional)

## 🔍 **CODE QUALITY**

### **Strengths:**

- ✅ **Clean Component Structure** - Logical separation of concerns
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Catches and displays errors
- ✅ **Debug Logging** - Console logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- ✅ **Accessibility** - Proper labels, ARIA attributes
- ✅ **Consistent Styling** - Matches other admin pages
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Proper null/undefined checks

### **Areas for Improvement:**

- ⚠️ **Remove Console Logs** - Should be removed in production
- ⚠️ **Error Messages** - Could be more user-friendly
- ⚠️ **Loading States** - Could add skeleton loaders

## 📝 **DATA STRUCTURE**

### **Visibility Rule Object:**

```javascript
{
  calendar_visibility_id: number,
  visibility_name: string,
  description: string | null,
  visible_to_role_ids: number[],
  visible_to_program_ids: number[],
  visible_to_campus_ids: number[],
  is_active: boolean,
  created_at: string,
  updated_at: string
}
```

### **Form Data:**

```javascript
{
  visibility_name: string (required),
  description: string (optional),
  visible_to_role_ids: number[] (at least one criteria required),
  visible_to_program_ids: number[],
  visible_to_campus_ids: number[],
  is_active: boolean (default: true)
}
```

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Critical):**

1. **Fix 422 Validation Error**

   - Check actual validation error message
   - Verify field names match backend expectations
   - Ensure data types are correct

2. **Fix Rules Not Appearing**
   - Check API response structure
   - Verify data path is correct
   - Test filtering logic

### **Short-term:**

1. **Implement Usage Check API**

   - Backend endpoint: `/academic-calendar-visibility/{id}/usage`
   - Returns: `{ is_used: boolean, event_count: number }`
   - Enable visual indicators for rules in use

2. **Remove Debug Logs**
   - Clean up console.log statements
   - Add proper logging system if needed

### **Long-term:**

1. **Add Bulk Operations**

   - Bulk activate/deactivate rules
   - Bulk delete (with validation)

2. **Add Rule Templates**

   - Pre-defined common rules
   - Quick setup for common scenarios

3. **Add Usage Analytics**
   - Show which events use each rule
   - Link to event list filtered by rule

- [ ] Create a new visibility rule with program only
- [ ] Create a new visibility rule with campus only
- [ ] Create a new visibility rule with multiple criteria
- [ ] Edit an existing rule
- [ ] Delete a rule not in use
- [ ] Try to delete a rule in use (should fail)
- [ ] Search for rules by name
- [ ] Filter rules by active/inactive
