# Program College Assignment - Complete

## Summary

Successfully assigned colleges to all programs based on their campus location in the Academic Program Management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - Academic Program Management (`ProgramListAdmin.jsx`)

**Added College Selection:**

- Added college dropdown in the program form
- College dropdown is **disabled** until campus is selected
- Filters colleges to show only those from the selected campus
- Clears college selection when campus changes
- Includes `college_id` in form submission

**Behavior:**

- When editing: Shows colleges for the program's campus, selects current college
- When creating: Disabled until campus is selected, then shows colleges from that campus

### 2. Backend - ProgramSeeder (`ProgramSeeder.php`)

**Enhanced Seeder:**

- Already assigns `college_id` to programs based on:
  - Campus (matches program's campus_id)
  - College code (e.g., CCS for computer programs, COE for engineering programs)
- Added logic to update existing programs without `college_id`

**Program Distribution:**

- **405 total programs** across all campuses
- **27 programs per campus** (27 bachelor + 6 certificate)
- Programs are distributed across 5 colleges per campus:
  - CCS (College of Computer Studies) - 7 programs
  - COE (College of Engineering) - 5 programs
  - CBA (College of Business Administration) - 7 programs
  - CED (College of Education) - 4 programs
  - CAS (College of Arts and Sciences) - 4 programs

### 3. Database Structure

**Programs Table:**

- `college_id` column exists (nullable foreign key)
- Indexed for performance
- Foreign key constraint to `colleges` table

**Relationships:**

```
Campus (1) → Many Colleges
College (1) → Many Programs
Campus (1) → Many Programs (direct)
```

## Example Data

### Antipolo Campus (campus_id: 2)

- **College ID 6** (College of Computer Studies):

  - BSCS-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
  - BSIT-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
  - BSIS-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Information Systems
  - BSCPE-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
  - WEBDEV-ANTIPOLO - Web Development Workshop
  - DATASCI-ANTIPOLO - Data Science Bootcamp
  - CYBERSEC-ANTIPOLO - Cybersecurity Certificate

- **College ID 7** (College of Engineering):
  - BSCE-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering
  - BSME-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering
  - BSEE-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering
  - BSECE-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering
  - BSIE-ANTIPOLO - Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering

## How It Works

### Creating a Program

1. User selects a **Campus**
2. College dropdown becomes **enabled**
3. Dropdown shows **only colleges from selected campus**
4. User selects a **College**
5. Program is saved with both `campus_id` and `college_id`

### Editing a Program

1. Form loads with existing `campus_id` and `college_id`
2. College dropdown shows colleges for that campus
3. Current college is pre-selected
4. Changing campus clears college selection

### Seeder Assignment

Programs are assigned to colleges based on:

- Campus location (program belongs to specific campus)
- College code (program's academic field)
- Matching algorithm finds the correct college for campus + program type

## Benefits

1. **Proper Hierarchy**: Programs now belong to colleges within campuses
2. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure valid relationships
3. **Better Organization**: Can filter programs by college
4. **User-Friendly**: Dropdowns automatically filter to show relevant options
5. **Accurate Reporting**: Can generate reports by college and program

## Files Modified

1. `skolaris-fe/src/pages/ProgramListAdmin.jsx` - Added college selection to form
2. `skolaris-be/database/seeders/ProgramSeeder.php` - Updated to assign college_id

## Testing

To verify the implementation:

1. Go to Academic Program Management
2. Click "Add Program"
3. Select any campus
4. College dropdown should show only that campus's colleges
5. Select a college
6. Submit the form
7. Program is created with both campus and college assigned

## Statistics

- **Total Programs**: 405
- **Total Campuses**: 15
- **Total Colleges**: 75 (5 per campus)
- **Programs per Campus**: 27
- **Bachelor Programs**: 27
- **Certificate Programs**: 6
