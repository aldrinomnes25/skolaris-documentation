## 📊 What This Section Explains

### **The Two-Layer System:**

1. **DEFAULT_CURRICULUM (Template Layer)**

   - Master plan created once
   - What students SHOULD take
   - Program-wide standard
   - No faculty, no slots, no term

2. **COURSE_OFFERINGS (Implementation Layer)**
   - Actual offerings created per term
   - What IS being offered NOW
   - Term-specific
   - Has faculty, has slots, has specific term

### **The Connection:**

```
DEFAULT_CURRICULUM (Blueprint)
        ↓
ACADEMIC_TERMS (When)
        ↓
COURSE_OFFERINGS (Bridge/Junction)
        ↓
ENROLLMENTS (Students)
```
