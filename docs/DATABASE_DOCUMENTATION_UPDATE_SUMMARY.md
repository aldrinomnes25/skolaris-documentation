## 📌 Important Notes

### Preserved for Process Documentation:

Even though these tables don't exist in the backend yet, they are **kept in the documentation** because:

1. ✅ **academic_terms** - Part of the planned curriculum management workflow
2. ✅ **default_curriculum** - Essential for template-based curriculum system
3. ✅ **course_offerings** - Critical for term-based course scheduling

### Clearly Marked as Planned:

- Visual indicators (🔜 icon, dashed borders, warning colors)
- Explicit "PLANNED FEATURE" labels
- Implementation status sections
- Dedicated "Planned Features" documentation section

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### For Backend Implementation:

If you want to implement the planned features:

1. **Create Migration**: `academic_terms` table
2. **Create Migration**: `default_curriculum` table
3. **Create Migration**: `course_offerings` table
4. **Alter Table**: Add `college_id` to `programs` table

### For Documentation:

1. When features are implemented, remove 🔜 indicators
2. Move tables from "Planned" to "Implemented" sections
3. Update ERDs to remove dashed borders
4. Update implementation status notes

---

**Documentation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE and ACCURATE  
**Ready for**: Development, Reference, Planning  
**Maintenance**: Update when planned features are implemented
